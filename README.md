# overbaard-sync-tool
Incubator for tool to sync between upstream and downstream Jira projects.

Once I see how it takes shape, the plan is to push it up somewhere public,
e.g. https://github.com/overbaard/overbaard. If it turns out to not be as generic as needed to make it public, it will remain private.
